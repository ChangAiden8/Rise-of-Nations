It contains a well detailed plan to assassinate the candidates for the 1938' electon, Armando Sales and José Américo. An action must be taken by us, even though our inteligence services can't deduct the veracity of the Document."

 bra.1.d:0 "As we finally stand in the brink of redemocratization, we must choose who is going to be our leader for the next 5 years. Adhemar de Barros is the former interventor for the São Paulo: He built roads, expanded the industries and rebuilt the State. Armando Sales is a long fighter for democracy: He governed São Paulo, giving the State's the continent's higher educational standards. The brigadier Eduardo Gomes is a former member of the Brazilian Air Force: He has became the main figure for the still-standing Tenentistas. Júlio Prestes has been elected president in 1930, having been the one deposed in the 1930' Coup d' Etat: He is a member of the Agrarian Elite and the former head of the PRP. Time has come for we to make our decisions."

 bra.3.d:0 "In view of the communist threat presented to us by the most excellent Captain Mourão, the President of the Republic Getúlio Vargas decided to take the final measure necessary to prevent a future socialist coup in federal territory. After Field Marshal Dutra and General Goes Monteiro pressured congress to declare the state of siege, His Excellency has decided to close congress all together. Thus, he proclaimed the new constitution, tearing the second one in a period of 7 years. The Polaca will expand the powers of the President, ilegalize the political parties and dismantle the socialist forces within the national congress."

The Integralists claim that the Emperor is an expansionist and visionary, who will restore Brazil to Glory. The others state that the Emperor, in spite of any ideology, must be prudent and moderate above all else. Who's right?"
 bra.5.b:0 "For Christ's sake, he's an Emperor, not an MP!"

 bra.10.d:0 "It is the year of 1936, the 114th of Independence and 47th of the Republic. Six years ago Mr. Getúlio Vargas assumed this honorable position as President of the Republic of the United States of Brazil. In the latter, the Civil War was seen in 32, followed by the rapid industrialization of the Noble State of São Paulo. At this moment, Brazil, in the first steps of its industrialization, disputes with its inferior neighbors for the control of the South Atlantic. In Europe, Adolf Hitler wakes Germany and promises salvation. In the United States, the Crisis kills many of starvation and leaves many others with no place to live. In Africa and Asia, France and England are stuggling to keep their empires alive. It is our time to perish or to rule. Glories to Brazil!"

 bra.11.d:0 "As Brazilian Officials seize our government's last bastion the scrict military presence of Brazilian authorities in our soil imply the formation of a puppet government, managed by a new chief of state under the tutelage of the President of the Federation, whose ideological doctrines will certainly align with those of the mainland Brazil itself. Through the Brazilian Department of Press and Propaganda (DIP), our cultural elites and great masses will, as time passes, gather around Brazilian schools of thought, maintaining the newly installed national order aligned to Brazil's interests."
 bra.11.a:0 "Do we even have a choice?"
 
 bra.12:0 "No longer a Brazilian Puppet!"
 bra.12.t:0 "No longer a Brazilian Puppet!"
 bra.12.d:0 "As the new national government is formed, under the sole guidance of our politicians and  our people the Federal-installed state retreats, seeking exile in mainland Brazil.

 bra.17.t:0 "A Voz do Brasil"
 bra.17.d:0 "The influence of the Americans in our internal politics, although present, would never manifest itself through public will if it were not the influence of the North American media on our people.To combat the presence of the Americans in our culture, we will expand the Voice of Brazil to include moments of appreciation of the national culture through the Rádio Nacional."
