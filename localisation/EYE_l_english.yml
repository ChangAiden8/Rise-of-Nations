The gun could fire 15 rounds a minute and had hydraulics, but with less penetration. The design would be shot down because Škoda was not supposed to be in the competition.

 SWI_irredentism_desc:0 "In 1919 the people of Vorarlberg voted to join their brethren in union. However, the capitalists and our own weak leaders refused to allow it! This cannot stand, those people are our own! We shall take what is ours, and perhaps a little more to compensate for time lost!"
 SWI_new_mil:0 "A Standing Army"
 SWI_new_mil_desc:0 "Our army has been restructured, our men have been prepped, and our economy redesigned to ready ourselves for offensive war. Now we stand with the other nations of the world. Switzerland shall do what it has not done for a millenium, we shall march to war!"

 SWI_end_neutral:0 "A Flexible Foreign Policy"

 SWI_join_allies:0 "Formal French Alliance"
 SWI_join_allies_desc:0 "Historically we have been on very good terms with the French, even coming up with joint plans should our country ever be attacked. New situations in the world however have caused us to wonder if perhaps we would best be served in an official alliance with France."
 SWI_french_tech:0 "French Technological Cooperation"
 SWI_french_tech_desc:0 "The French did not win the Great War through pur luck. On their side were scientists and researchers. The British and French may have both developed tanks to cross the trenches, but the French were the ones whose design has become the template for so many tanks produced even now.

 SWI_army:0 "Review the Military"

 SWI_end_con_desc:0 "Until now conscription has served our country well, but times have changed and that method will no longer work. Instead, we must work towards a more modern professional army.

 SWI_con_to_army:0 "Institute a Draft"
 SWI_con_to_army_desc:0 "In order for us to have a standing army, we must first have men to serve in that army. We already have people on record as ready to serve. Well, it is time for them to serve."
 SWI_improve_con:0 "Improved Militia Training"
 SWI_improve_con_desc:0 "The army relies implicitly on the militia, and we cannot allow them to be anything but the best. Training needs to cover every possible situation so that our men can fight in any situation at any time."

 SWI_fighter_focus:0 "Defenders of the Sky"
 SWI_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The most important job of the Air Force is protecting our skies from those who would dare try to enter our airspace. We must ensure that our fighters are prepped and ready to fight any enemy, preferably more than ready."
 SWI_focus_home_air:0 "Focus on Domestic Models"
 SWI_focus_home_air_desc:0 "The Swiss air industry must be expanded! We cannot always rely on foreign models to defend our lands, instead we must develop our own models for defence. "
 SWI_focus_foreign_air:0 "Focus on License Production"
 SWI_focus_foreign_air_desc:0 "Switzerland simply lacks the industry to develop its own aircraft in any significan amount. We must focus on ensuring foreign airplane purchases and licenses!"
 SWI_defend_homeskies:0 "Air Defence Techniques"

 SWI_interceptors:0 "Interceptors"
 SWI_interceptors_desc:0 "With the knowledge of rockets, we have come to realize the power of an aircraft that can quickly take off and fight. That it cannot go very far is not of any concern to us, for their job will be to protect the Swiss homeland from those who would dare defile it."
 SWI_other_air:0 "Alternative Aircraft"
 SWI_other_air_desc:0 "Switzerland has focused very heavily on fighters, and for the most part this is good, but we cannot forget that other plane types do exist, and looking into them, even just to check for their weaknesses, may be wise."
 SWI_naval_doc:0 "Establish Naval Doctrine"
 SWI_naval_doc_desc:0 "With no access to the sea, or even any sizeable lakes, we have had no need to actually establish any sort of Naval doctrine. However, circumstances have now changed, and we must quickly work on that which we have forgotten."
 SWI_build_docks:0 "Create a Swiss Naval Industry"
 SWI_build_docks_desc:0 "Landlocked we may have been, but we now have access to the sea! We may not have any prior planning for this, but we should not waste this opportunity! We cannot gain experience at sea if we do not have the capacity to build ships in order to get ships onto that sea in the first place!"
 SWI_reform_flotilla:0 "Reform the Lake Flotilla"
 SWI_reform_flotilla_desc:0 "Up until this point, the entirety of Swiss naval thought involved only the use of brown-water boats to protect our lakes and rivers. Now everything has changed. and a naval Branch of our military has become a necessity. We must take what experienced crew members we have, and begin the creation of our own, oceongoing navy!"
 SWI_naval_catchup:0 "Foreign Naval Technology"
 SWI_naval_catchup_desc:0 "We cannot lie to ourselves, we have not prepared for the eventuality of actually having a coastline. We do not know how to build ships, and we certainly don't know how to build modern military vessels! Should we wish to compete navally, we will have to import some foreign talent and ideas, if just so we can sail on even sea levels!"
 SWI_expand_docks:0 "Expand the Dockyards"
 SWI_expand_docks_desc:0 "Now that we have created a naval industry for ourselves, the time has come for us to expand it dramatically, and bring forth the full power of Swiss engineering."
 SWI_fast_build_navy:0 "A Pressing Need for Ships"
 SWI_fast_build_navy_desc:0 "We have spent years without so much as a single naval idea, and only trade ideas for our maritime practices. We do not even have a past history of exploration by sea. Now, however, we have marched to the shore, and developed a navy of our own. We may have to play catch-up with the rest of the world, but we will be damned if we don't at the very least make a go at becoming a naval force to be reckoned with!"
 SWI_naval_air:0 "Naval Aircraft"
 SWI_naval_air_desc:0 "With a shoreline and sea access comes a concern we had not previosuly forseen. The need for planes that deal with airspace over the open waters. We must tackle this problem head on, and create planes that are up to this unique challenge!"

 SWI_end_neutral_left:0 "Join the International Community"
 SWI_end_neutral_left_desc:0 "For too long our country has stood unable to join those who fight for the plight of the lower classes, bound to outdated ideas of neutrality. Its time that our foreign policy was updated."

 SWI_support_friends:0 "Support Anti-Fascism"
 SWI_support_friends_desc:0 "Fascism is a morally repugnant ideology, suited only for the dredges of humanity. We must fight with every fiber of our beings. Anyone is better than a fascist, and we will support the fight as best we are able."
 SWI_anti_communism:0 "Support Anti-Communism"
 SWI_anti_communism_desc:0 "Communism, the opiate of the clueless masses who do not understand that which they preach. We cannot allow this dangerous ideology to spread any longer. We must support those who fight against this horrid ideology, at any cost."
 SWI_foreign_trade:0 "Foreign Trade Investment"

 SWI_secret_wunderwaffe_desc:0 "Our scientists have come forth with news that it has become possible to wield the power of creation itself, the atom, in order to create a bomb the likes of which the world has never seen.
