Finished sequenced is defined to mean that there is no more than one error in 10,000 bases sequenced and the sequence is nearly continuous, having just a small number of short gaps. Some areas of the genome are difficult, if not impossible, to sequence using current technology. Fortunately, these areas are few and far between and most probably do not contain genes."
