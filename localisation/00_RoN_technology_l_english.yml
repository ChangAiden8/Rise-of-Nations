### RON UNIQUE NUCLEAR TREE

RON_Radioactive_Materials:0 "Radioactive Materials"
RON_Radioactive_Materials_desc:0 "Radioactive materials are used to help some researchers create and test new medicines, technologies, and procedures that benefit plants, animals and people. Research laboratories must follow strict rules to order, store, use and dispose of radioactive material."
RON_Radiography:0 "Radiography"
RON_Radiography_desc:0 "Radiography is an imaging technique using X-rays, gamma rays, or similar ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation to view the internal form of an object. Applications of radiography include medical radiography ('diagnostic' and 'therapeutic') and industrial radiography."
RON_Nuclear_Fission:0 "Nuclear Fission"
RON_Nuclear_Fission_desc:0 "In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller, lighter nuclei. The fission process often produces gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay."
RON_Atomic_Research:0 "Atomic Research"
RON_Atomic_Research_desc:0 "In nuclear fission, splitting the atom yields enormous amounts of energy and limitless destructive capability."
RON_Nuclear_Reactor:0 "Nuclear Reactor"
RON_Nuclear_Reactor_desc:0 "This building provides the state with production of enriched Uranium for use in Nuclear weapons."
RON_Nukes:0 "Nuclear Bomb"
RON_Nukes_desc:0 "A project to construct an atomic bomb will be one of the most secretive and difficult tasks a nation can undertake, but, if successful, may change not only the course of today's wars but of the future of the world."
RON_Thermonuclear_Bomb:0 "Thermonuclear Bomb I"
RON_Thermonuclear_Bomb_desc:0 "A thermonuclear weapon, fusion weapon or hydrogen bomb (H bomb), is a second-generation nuclear weapon design. Its greater sophistication affords it vastly greater destructive power than first-generation atomic bombs, a more compact size, a lower mass or a combination of these benefits. Characteristics of nuclear fusion reactions make possible the use of non-fissile depleted uranium as the weapon's main fuel, thus allowing more efficient use of scarce fissile material such as uranium-235 (U-235) or plutonium-239 (Pu-239)."
RON_Thermonuclear_Bomb2:0 "Thermonuclear Bomb II"
RON_Thermonuclear_Bomb2_desc:0 "A thermonuclear weapon, fusion weapon or hydrogen bomb (H bomb), is a second-generation nuclear weapon design. Its greater sophistication affords it vastly greater destructive power than first-generation atomic bombs, a more compact size, a lower mass or a combination of these benefits. Characteristics of nuclear fusion reactions make possible the use of non-fissile depleted uranium as the weapon's main fuel, thus allowing more efficient use of scarce fissile material such as uranium-235 (U-235) or plutonium-239 (Pu-239)."
RON_Thermonuclear_Bomb3:0 "Thermonuclear Bomb III"
RON_Thermonuclear_Bomb3_desc:0 "A thermonuclear weapon, fusion weapon or hydrogen bomb (H bomb), is a second-generation nuclear weapon design. Its greater sophistication affords it vastly greater destructive power than first-generation atomic bombs, a more compact size, a lower mass or a combination of these benefits. Characteristics of nuclear fusion reactions make possible the use of non-fissile depleted uranium as the weapon's main fuel, thus allowing more efficient use of scarce fissile material such as uranium-235 (U-235) or plutonium-239 (Pu-239)."
RON_Neutron_Bomb:0 "Neutron Bomb"
RON_Neutron_Bomb_desc:0 "A neutron bomb, officially defined as a type of enhanced radiation weapon (ERW), is a low yield thermonuclear weapon designed to maximize lethal neutron radiation in the immediate vicinity of the blast while minimizing the physical power of the blast itself."
RON_Improved_Miniaturization:0 "Improved Miniaturization"
RON_Improved_Miniaturization_desc:0 "Smaller Warheads will allow our missiles to weigh less and travel longer distances."
RON_Orbital_Launch_Site:0 "Orbital Launch Site"
RON_Orbital_Launch_Site_desc:0 "A launch site orbiting our planet will allow for a higher efficiency when targetting and launching missiles."
RON_Antimatter_Bomb:0 "Antimatter Bomb"
RON_Antimatter_Bomb_desc:0 "An antimatter weapon is a theoretically possible device using antimatter as a power source, a propellant, or an explosive for a weapon. Antimatter weapons cannot yet be produced due to the current cost of production of antimatter (estimated at 63 trillion dollars per gram) given the extremely limited technology available to create it in sufficient masses to be viable in a weapon, and the fact that it annihilates upon touching ordinary matter, making containment very difficult."
RON_MIRV:0 "MIRV"
RON_MIRV_desc:0 "A multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) is a missile payload containing several warheads, each capable of being aimed to hit a different target. The concept is almost invariably associated with intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying thermonuclear warheads, even if not strictly being limited to them. By contrast, a unitary warhead is a single warhead on a single missile. An intermediate case is the multiple reentry vehicle (MRV) missile which carries several warheads which are dispersed but not individually aimed."
RON_MHD_Department:0 "MHD Department"
RON_MHD_Department_desc:0 "A magnetohydrodynamic generator (MHD generator) is a magnetohydrodynamic converter that utilizes a Brayton cycle to transform thermal energy and kinetic energy directly into electricity. MHD generators are different from traditional electric generators in that they operate without moving parts (e.g. no turbine) to limit the upper temperature."
RON_Nuclear_Reactor_MK1:0 "Nuclear Reactor MK1"
RON_Nuclear_Reactor_MK1_desc:0 "Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power plant. Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions."
RON_Tomahawk_Reactor:0 "Tomahawk Reactor"
RON_Tomahawk_Reactor_desc:0 "Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power plant. Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions."
RON_Fission_Reactor1:0 "Fission Reactor 1"
RON_Fission_Reactor1_desc:0 "Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power plant. Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions."
RON_Fission_Reactor2:0 "Fission Reactor 2"
RON_Fission_Reactor2_desc:0 "Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power plant. Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions."
RON_Fission_Reactor3:0 "Fission Reactor 3"
RON_Fission_Reactor3_desc:0 "Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power plant. Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions."
RON_EPR_Technology:0 "EPR Technology"
RON_EPR_Technology_desc:0 "The EPR is a third generation pressurised water reactor design. It has been designed and developed mainly by Framatome (part of Areva between 2001 and 2017) and Électricité de France (EDF) in France, and Siemens in Germany. In Europe this reactor design was called European Pressurised Reactor, and the internationalised name was Evolutionary Power Reactor, but it is now simply named EPR."
RON_Fusion_Reactor:0 "Fusion Reactor"
RON_Fusion_Reactor_desc:0 "Fusion power is a proposed form of power generation that would generate electricity by using heat from nuclear fusion reactions. In a fusion process, two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, while releasing energy. Devices designed to harness this energy are known as fusion reactors."
