RON_Juggernog_desc:0 "Juggernog is a Perk in Call of Duty: World at War and Call of Duty: Black Ops. It appears in every Nazi Zombies map (excluding Nacht der Untoten). It is the zombies equivalent of Juggernaut. Juggernog costs 2500 points in every map in which it is available. When purchased it will increase the player's health, allowing them to take more damage (four hits before red, the fifth being death)."
RON_Monkey_Bombs_desc:0 "When primed and thrown, it will explode in about nine seconds, killing some of the Zombies around it. The Monkey Bomb has a unique ability to distract any zombie that is not currently attacking a player. They are very useful in tight situations or when an ally needs to be revived. "

RON_Early_Rocketry_desc:0 "Modern rockets originated when Goddard attached a supersonic nozzle to the combustion chamber of a liquid-fueled rocket engine. These nozzles turn the hot gas from the combustion chamber into a cooler, hypersonic, highly directed jet of gas, more than doubling the thrust and raising the engine efficiency from 2% to 64%. On 16 March 1926 Robert Goddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled rocket in Auburn, Massachusetts."
RON_Pulsoreactors_desc:0 "A pulse jet is a pulsating jet engine. The first prototype was created and patented by the Girona engineer Ramón Casanova i Danés in 1917 and could be mounted on cars and aircraft.1 It was the first mass-produced reactor for warfare in history. Specifically, the Argus I model was designed to propel the V1 flying bomb."
RON_Integrated_Guidance_System_desc:0 "A guidance system is a virtual or physical device, or a group of devices implementing a guidance process used for controlling the movement of a ship, aircraft, missile, rocket, satellite, or any other moving object.

RON_Multi_Staged_Rockets_desc:0 "A multistage rocket, or step rocket is a launch vehicle that uses two or more rocket stages, each of which contains its own engines and propellant. A tandem or serial stage is mounted on top of another stage; a parallel stage is attached alongside another stage. The result is effectively two or more rockets stacked on top of or attached next to each other. Two-stage rockets are quite common, but rockets with as many as five separate stages have been successfully launched."
RON_Develop_Missiles_desc:0 "In military language, a missile, also known as a guided missile, is a guided airborne ranged weapon capable of self-propelled flight usually by a jet engine or rocket motor. Missiles have four system components: targeting/guidance system, flight system, engine and warhead. Missiles come in types adapted for different purposes: surface-to-surface and air-to-surface missiles (ballistic, cruise, anti-ship, anti-tank, etc.), surface-to-air missiles (and anti-ballistic), air-to-air missiles, and anti-satellite weapons."
RON_First_Satellite_desc:0 "Satellites are used for many purposes. Among several other applications, they can be used to make star maps and maps of planetary surfaces, and also take pictures of planets they are launched into. Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites, communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and space telescopes. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites."
RON_Early_Spy_Satellite_desc:0 "By carefully scanning and monitoring the surrounding area, the spy satellite is able to give moment-by-moment reports on activity happening below.
