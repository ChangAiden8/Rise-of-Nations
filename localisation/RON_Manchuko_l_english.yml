 ### Event for CHI to puppet MEN
 umc_maw.10.t:0 "Young Marshal leads Northeastern Army to Manchuria"
 umc_maw.10.d:0 "In 1930, when warlords Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan attempted to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government, Zhang stepped in to support the Nanjing-based government against the Northern warlords in exchange for control of the key railroads in Hebei Province and the customs revenues from the port city of Tianjin. A year later, in the September 18 Mukden Incident, Japanese troops attacked Zhang's forces in Mukden in order to provoke a full-on war with China, which Chiang did not want until his forces were stronger. In accordance with this strategy, Zhang's armies withdrew from the front lines without significant engagements, leading to the effective Japanese occupation of Zhang's Fengtian Clique and its former northeastern domain.\n\nDuring this, Zhang was aware of how weak his forces were compared to the Japanese and wished to preserve his position in China by retaining a sizeable army. Therefore his Northeastern Army marched with him to China, where it remained under control of the Young Marshal.\n\nNow, with the situation on the Japenese Home Islands escalated to the full scale civil war, Manchuria remains in the hands of the Last Emperor Puyi who is led or even controlled by the Japanese generals stationed there as a part of the Kwantung Army. In response to that, the Young Marshal leads his Northeastern Army back north to Manchuria once again, in a dare reclamation campaign.\n\nWhile the population of China is supportive towards getting rid of the Japanese the speculations are whether by this action Zhang tore his ties with the Kuomintang or whether this campaign is supported by Chiang Kai-shek."
