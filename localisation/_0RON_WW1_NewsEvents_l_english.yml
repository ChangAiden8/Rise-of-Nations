ronww1_news.1.d:0 "The Sultan Mehmed V tragically passed away on the 3rd of July 1918 at the age of 73 (only four months before the end of WWI, thus he did not see the downfall of the Empire). During his Reign since the forced abdication of his Brother Abdulhamid II by the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, Mehmed V had no 'real power' he was mainly a figure head. His main political act was declaring a Jihad, or a Struggle against the Entente Powers on November 14th 1914 following the Ottoman Empire's decision to join the war on the side of the Central Powers."
