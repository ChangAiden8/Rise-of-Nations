ronww2_news.1.t:0 "Mona Lisa Stolen!"
ronww2_news.1.d:0 "Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, also known as La Gioconda, is the most famous painting in the world. Quantities of effort and ink have been spent over the years on identifying who she was and deciding what her enigmatic smile signifies, what she says about femininity, if anything, and why she has no eyebrows. Leonardo took the painting with him when he was invited to France by Francis I in 1516. The king bought it and at the French Revolution it was placed in the Louvre. Napoleon took it away to hang in his bedroom, but it was returned to the Louvre afterwards."

RNM_creationevents.1.t:0 "The Prague Manifesto"
RNM_creationevents.1.d:0 "The goals of the committee were embodied in a document known as the Prague Manifesto. The manifesto's fourteen points guaranteed the freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly, as well as a right to self-determination of any ethnic group living in territories belonging to Russia. The Prague Manifesto did not contain any explicit anti-semitic or other racially inspired rhetoric, which caused a conflict with many Nazi propagandists. Although, criticism aimed at the Western Allies (specifically US and UK) was included in the manifesto's preamble. The chairman of the committee was General Andrey Vlasov, who also commanded the Russian Liberation Army. The committee was viewed as the political arm of the Russian Liberation Army, although it also united several Ukrainian and other ethnic forces that were anti-Soviet.\nRegarding our cooperation with this committee, Alfred Rosenberg, The Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories has drafted 3 Possible Political Entities for this New Russia.\n\nOption A - A New Russia consisting only on ethnically Russian Territories, with the other Soviet Republics being disposed of as we see fit.\n\nOption B - A New Russia based on our 1938 Eastern Border with the USSR, plus a few annexations on our part, as compensation for the monetary cost of the liberation of the USSR.\n\nOption C - A New Russian Empire, based on our 1914 Borders with the Russian Empire. This Option is only available if you are the German Empire.\n\nWhat should this New State Look Like?"
