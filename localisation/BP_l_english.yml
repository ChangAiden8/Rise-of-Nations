GER_heydrich_deputy_reichsprotektor_bohemia_desc:0 "Initially, this position was appointed by former German foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath. His tenure was accompanied by rivalry between the secret services loyal to the protector and the party structures caused by the overlapping competence of different branches of power. This, and the lack of rigidity of Neurath during the suppression of Czech resistance, resulted in his actual removal from office.\n \nAt the end of September 1941, Hitler summoned von Neurath and said that he had decided to appoint him Deputy Heydrich. Von Neurath disagreed with this decision and announced his resignation from this post. Then Hitler sent von Neurath on "indefinite vacation". His duties were transferred to Heydrich as "acting reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia" (ger. "Stellvertretender Reichsprotektor von Böhmen und Mähren").\n \nThus, Heydrich became the actual Reichsprotektor (von Neurath never returned to his duties), retaining the post of head of the Directorate of the RSHA. On September 27, 1941, Heydrich took up residence in Hradcany. His summer residence, which moved his family, Heydrich gave in to get him after the resignation of K. von Neurath, the so-called "Lower Palace" in the town Panenske-Brzezany 15 km to the North from Prague, confiscated from sharoprokatnogo Jewish origin of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer."

In the supporters of Great Italy also considered Albania, Montenegro, Northern Tunisia. They also insisted on a closer incorporation of Northern Libya, conquered ("General terms") in 1911-1912.

The Hanko Peninsula was leased to the USSR as a naval base.Occupation of Norway by Germany, which cut off Finland from direct ties with great Britain and France, led to the fact that since may 1940 Finland has committed to strengthening relations with Nazi Germany. At this time in Germany on the orders of Adolf Hitler began to develop a plan of attack on the Soviet Union, Finland acquired the interest for Germany as a base for the deployment of troops and a base for military operations, as well as a possible ally in the war against the Soviet Union. On August 19, 1940, the German government terminated the arms embargo on Finland in exchange for allowing the use of Finnish territory for the transit of German troops to Norway. Although Finland was still suspicious of Germany because of its policies during the Winter war, the Finns saw it as the only Savior.Finland expressed its readiness to join Germany in its war against the USSR under several conditions:\n \nGuarantee of independence of Finland;\n \nReturn the border with the USSR to pre-war (or better) condition;\n \nContinuation of the food supply;\n \n pFinland is not an aggressor, that is, enters the war only after being attacked by the Soviet Union.\n \n21—June 25 from the territory of Finland against the USSR acted naval and air forces of Germany. 22 Jun 1941 in response to the occupation of the Finnish troops of the demilitarized zone of åland of the Finnish troops was bombed by Soviet aviation.

In the Third Reich, Iranian youth, the military, whom Goebbels propaganda called "Sons of Zaratushtra", are being trained. German ideologists declared the Persians "Pure Aryans" and they were exempted from the Nuremberg Racial Laws by a special decree. As a result, by the beginning of the Second World War, the Third Reich had gained a strong position in Iran, and in fact the country was turning into a German base in the Middle East region. By 1941, the situation with Iran and its "Aryan bias" for Moscow and London was as follows: there was a real threat that Iran's oil and transport infrastructure built on British capital will be used by the Third Reich against the USSR and Britain. Thus, only one oil refinery in Abadan processed 8 million tons of oil in 1940. And aviation gasoline in the whole region was produced only in Baku and Abadan. In addition, if the German armed forces broke from North Africa to Palestine, Syria, or in 1942 reached the border of Baku – Derbent – Astrakhan, Turkey and Iran's entry into the war on the side of Germany would be a matter resolved. In connection with the planned offensive of the Wehrmacht deep into the Soviet Union, the Persian corridor, passing through the territory of the TRANS-Iranian railway, was one of the easiest ways to implement the lend-lease program implemented by the United States by sea. British and Soviet engineers recognized the great importance of this railway and sought to keep it under close attention. The increased number of attacks by German submarines and the ice covering of the sea in the area of Arkhangelsk have increased the danger of using this route, so that the need for the use of the railway has increased significantly. Moreover, the Soviet government sought to include Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmensahra ("Turkmen plain") part of the state, and to bring to power in Iran, the Communists. The pressure of the UK and the USSR on Iran led to an increase in tension and a massive anti-British speech in Tehran, which, according to the British, were of a Pro-German nature. Iran's strategic position hampered the security of the Soviet oil-producing areas and the rear of the red Army and threatened British military routes between India and the Mediterranean."

Altai contains reserves of mercury and gold, lakes in The kulundin steppes — deposits of different salts.\n \nAnnexation of the territory beyond the Ural mountains is not only a logistical nightmare, but also a risk for our long - term goals. The Ostministerium proposed to establish a Reichskommissariat West Siberia, which will perform several important functions in the New Order. \n \nFirstly, the deportation of indigenous people from our conquered territories must be effective. This Commissariat will exist as a transit point and the absorption of part of this population,ensuring that the uprising in our Eastern territories will be minimized.

Later, Himmler appointed him to form the SD (Sicherheitsdienst) and by 1933 Heydrich had attained the rank of Obergruppenfuehrer (Lieutenant-General). Together with staunch Nazis Kurt Daluege and Walter Schellenberg, Heydrich organized the purging of Ernest Roehm's SA (Sturmabteilung). This massacre would later be known as the 'Night of the Long Knives'. In 1936 Heydrich became head of the SD and the Gestapo. When Himmler and the SS were put in charge of the concentration camps, Heydrich was assigned to Czechoslovakia where he intended to 'Germanize the Czech vermin'. Luckily the Czech resistance (with some help from the British MI6) put a stop to Heydrich's bloody reign. Heydrich was killed when an assassination squad tossed an anti-tank grenade in his car. One of Hitler's most evil henchmen was dead, but the German retaliation would be savage and brutal.

The name Reichsgau Wartheland was introduced on 29 January 1940. It comprised the Greater Poland and adjacent areas, and only in part matched the area of the similarly named pre-Versailles Prussian province of Posen. The name was initially derived from the capital city, Posen (Poznan), and later from the main river, Warthe (Warta). The territory was inhabited by Poles and a German minority (16.7 percent of total population in 1921). In the Wartheland, the Nazis' goal was complete 'Germanization', or political, cultural, social, and economic assimilation of the territory into the German Reich. In pursuit of this goal, the installed bureaucracy renamed streets and cities and seized tens of thousands of Polish enterprises, from large industrial firms to small shops, without payment to the owners. \n \nAs early as October 1939, many Poles were expelled from the annexed lands to make room for German colonizers. Only those Poles selected for Germanization, approximately 1.7 million including thousands of children who had been taken from their parents, were permitted to remain, and if they resisted it, they were to be sent to concentration camps, because "German blood must not be utilized in the interest of a foreign nation". By the end of 1940, at least 325,000 Poles from annexed lands were forcibly resettled in the General Government, forced to abandon most of their property"

Few were ardent Nazis, some explored the economic possibilities of providing the German occupiers with supplies and goods. Others eventually formed resistance groups towards the latter part of the war. The majority of Danes, however, were unwillingly compliant towards the Germans. As a result of the cooperative attitude of the Danish authorities, German officials claimed that they would 'respect Danish sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as neutrality.' Their only strong interest in Denmark, that of surplus agricultural products, would be supplied by price policy on food rather than by control and restriction.

Croatia was to gain independence, but under Hungarian influence. On 12 April, the plan was transformed into a draft "preliminary directions for the partition of Yugoslavia", as directed by Hitler.

This greatly influenced the party of Mosley, who were known as the "black shirts" of the uniforms they wore.

Actually, the German proposals were supplemented by the ideas voiced by Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria.\n \nNow that the enemy is defeated and Yugoslavia is under the strict control of the Axis countries, we can start a plan of division of the Yugoslav state among the allies: we can divide Yugoslavia among all members of the axis in accordance with their claims, so that all powers will have their own, in addition to this transfer Dalmatia under full control of Italy, as well as to hold a section without the participation of Italy or Hungary with Bulgaria, which will allow us to have almost full control over the Balkans."

# The Swedish Question

BP_germany.300.t:0 "The Swedish Question"
BP_germany.300.d:0 "Sweden found itself in a tenuous position during the events of the Second World War. Having maintained its neutrality since the end of Napoleonic Wars in 1815, it was only through a careful balance of diplomatic maneuvering and concessions to Germany that Sweden was able to maintain its sovereignty and avoid direct involvement in the conflict. During Operation Barbarossa, Sweden allowed the Wehrmacht railway transit for personnel and munitions into Finland. The country was also a vital trading partner that supplied critical iron ore to the Reich. As the war neared its conclusion in 1944 and 1945, they allowed the Allies to use Swedish air bases. Sweden also became an important destination for refugees fleeing the war, including Jewish and other persecuted populations.\n \nHitler's personal of view of the Swedish was generally positive, as he viewed the Scandinavian people to be of the purest Nordic descent. Sweden was not occupied during the war for a variety of reasons, not least of which was that occupation would have been costly and that the Swedes were generally compliant with the Reich's interests. With the conclusion of the war against the Soviet Union, their incorporation into the Greater Germanic Reich can now be accomplished. It is time to unite all Germanic people under our banner!"

BP_germany.301.t:0 "Fate of Scandinavia"
BP_germany.301.d:0 "The Reichskommissariats in western Europe differed considerably from their eastern counterparts. The regimes set up in Belgium and the Netherlands were intended to factilitate a transitional incorporation into the Reich, in contrast to the Russian conquests which focused on colonization and exploitation. Historically, a Reichskommissariat division did not encompass all of Scandinavia, though the regime established in Norway serves as an example for this concept. Hitler vowed that he would never leave Norway, and even favored the annexation of Denmark at a later date. The Nordic people of Scandinavia were destined to become part of the Reich once Hitler's vision came to fruition.\n \nNow that we have brought all of Scandinavia under our control, we can create a new Reichsprotektorat to ensure that this area will become an integral part of the German nation. Its population will retain their native languages and customs for a time, while the next generation will be educated to identify solely with their Germanic racial character and no longer see themselves as part of disparate nationalities. They will be taught to celebrate their Aryan heritage and embrace National Socialist ideology. With time, the Greater Germanic Reich will be one people and one nation!"

The lengthy fighting in Norway resulted in intensified German demands for indirect support from Sweden, demands that Swedish diplomats were able to fend off by reminding the Germans of the Swedes' feeling of closeness to their Norwegian brethren. With the conclusion of hostilities in Norway this argument became untenable, forcing the Cabinet to give in to German pressure and allow continuous (unarmed) troop transports, via Swedish railroads, between Germany and Norway. The extent of these transports was kept secret, although spreading rumors soon forced prime minister Per Albin Hansson to admit their existence. Officially the trains transported wounded soldiers and soldiers on leave, which would still have been in violation of Sweden's proclaimed neutrality. In all, close to 100,000 railroad cars had transported 1,004,158 military personnel on leave to Germany and 1,037,158 to Norway through Sweden by the time the transit agreement was disbanded on 15 August 1943."

With its loss, Finland lost a fifth of its industry and 11 per cent of its agricultural land. 12 % of the population, or about 400 thousand people, had to be resettled from the territories assigned to the USSR. The Hanko Peninsula was leased to the USSR as a naval base.Occupation of Norway by Germany, which cut off Finland from direct ties with great Britain and France, led to the fact that since may 1940 Finland has committed to strengthening relations with Nazi Germany. At this time in Germany on the orders of Adolf Hitler began to develop a plan of attack on the Soviet Union, Finland acquired the interest for Germany as a base for the deployment of troops and a base for military operations, as well as a possible ally in the war against the Soviet Union. On August 19, 1940, the German government terminated the arms embargo on Finland in exchange for allowing the use of Finnish territory for the transit of German troops to Norway. Although Finland was still suspicious of Germany because of its policies during the Winter war, the Finns saw it as the only Savior.Finland expressed its readiness to join Germany in its war against the USSR under several conditions:\n \nGuarantee of independence of Finland;\n \nReturn the border with the USSR to pre-war (or better) condition;\n \nContinuation of the food supply;\n \nFinland is not an aggressor, that is, enters the war only after being attacked by the Soviet Union.\n \n21—June 25 from the territory of Finland against the USSR acted naval and air forces of Germany. 22 Jun 1941 in response to the occupation of the Finnish troops of the demilitarized zone of åland of the Finnish troops was bombed by Soviet aviation. On June 25, the Soviet air force carried out air strikes on 18 Finnish airfields from which it was struck, and several settlements.

The concept of "Pan-Turkism" between Turkey and Azerbaijan was also seen as a threat by German leadership during this time and it was considered to be in the Reich's interest to ensure that nationalistic movements in the Middle East fell under their sphere of influences to ensure their vision of the New Order was achieved fully."

The destroyed economy and the new movement of Pan-Turkic Nationalism led the country into a difficult situation, as a result of which the Turkish government declared neutrality in the new conflict, which began to flare up in Europe.\n \nWhen German tanks were 50 miles from Istanbul during the incursions into Yugoslavia and Greece, the Turkish leadership destroyed key bridges in anticipation of further German aggression in the area. The Non-Aggression Pact, signed in 1941 just four days before the invasion of the Soviet Union, eased tensions between the factions involved, as the Axis, Allies and the Soviet Union closely monitored Turkey and the situation in the region.\n \nWith the success of operation "Barbarossa", Turkey can no longer take a neutral position. The Reich should have full control over the Black Sea for the transportation of crude oil from the oil fields of the Caucasus and the implementation of the plan Ost in the Crimea. The Middle East must be brought into our sphere of influence, and Turkey is on our way. Although Hitler was nominally respectful of the Turks as former allies in World War I, he understood that the head of the Republic of Turkey, Ismet Inon, could not be trusted. His refusal to cooperate more actively with the Axis in the past, along with his conciliatory attitude towards refugees leaving our occupied territories, can no longer be tolerated.

The British were well aware that Turkey is on the border of Europe and the Middle East and can be used as a way to strike at Syria, Iraq and the threat to India. Finally, the Soviet Union, with its historical Russian antagonism towards the Ottoman Empire, did not leave any of these problems unnoticed and knew that their possessions in the Caucasus could be threatened if Turkey sided with the Germans.\n \nDuring the war, Turkey came under our occupation. We must now decide the fate of the region. Anatolia is a complex region full of diverse national groups with different interests, many of which were under the centuries-old occupation of the Turks.

On 1 April 1941, the regime of Regent Abd al-Ilah was overthrown, and Rashid Ali al-Gaylani was declared Prime Minister. The coup was led by four Iraqi generals, who were in the nationalist group 'Golden Square'. Since Iraq gained only formal independence in 1932, the aim of the group was to use the war to achieve full independence and the establishment of the pan-Arab state, which led to cooperation with German intelligence and the adoption of military assistance from Germany.

In Turkey, pan-turkists ' activities directed against the USSR were encouraged.

In August 1942, Saracoğlu, immediately upon taking office as Prime Minister, told Papin that "as a Turk, he longs for the destruction of Russia", that "every Turk, even writing for the British Yalchin, can not think about it other than he", and that "the Russian problem can be solved by Germany, only if it is killed at least half of all Russians living in Russia"."

Despite the strong position of British capital, which played a key role in the Iranian economy, the geopolitical bias towards the Third Reich became stronger. In addition, since 1933 Berlin has taken relations with Iran to a new qualitative level. Reich begins to take an active part in the development of the economy, infrastructure of Iran, the reform of the armed forces of the monarchy. In the Third Reich, Iranian youth, the military, whom Goebbels propaganda called "Sons of Zaratushtra", are being trained. German ideologists declared the Persians "Pure Aryans" and they were exempted from the Nuremberg Racial Laws by a special decree. As a result, by the beginning of the Second World War, the Third Reich had gained a strong position in Iran, and in fact the country was turning into a German base in the Middle East region. By 1941, the situation with Iran and its "aryan bias" for Moscow and London was as follows: there was a real threat that Iran's oil and transport infrastructure built on British capital will be used by the Third Reich against the USSR and Britain. Thus, only one oil refinery in Abadan processed 8 million tons of oil in 1940. And aviation gasoline in the whole region was produced only in Baku and Abadan. In addition, if the German armed forces broke from North Africa to Palestine, Syria, or in 1942 reached the border of Baku – Derbent – Astrakhan, Turkey and Iran's entry into the war on the side of Germany would be a matter resolved. In connection with the planned offensive of the Wehrmacht deep into the Soviet Union, the Persian corridor, passing through the territory of the trans-Iranian railway, was one of the easiest ways to implement the lend-lease program implemented by the United States by sea. British and Soviet engineers recognized the great importance of this railway and sought to keep it under close attention. The increased number of attacks by German submarines and the ice covering of the sea in the area of Arkhangelsk have increased the danger of using this route, so that the need for the use of the railway has increased significantly. Moreover, the Soviet government sought to include Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmensahra ("Turkmen plain") part of the state, and to bring to power in Iran, the Communists. The pressure of the UK and the USSR on Iran led to an increase in tension and a massive anti-British speech in Tehran, which, according to the British, were of a Pro-German nature. Iran's strategic position hampered the security of the Soviet oil-producing areas and the rear of the red Army and threatened British military routes between India and the Mediterranean."

BP_germany.500.d:0 "In 1941, German industry and inter-European imports would supply enough food, fuel and ammunition to support a partly motorized army of about three million men in a great field campaign, planned to last about seventeen weeks. With almost a year to prepare, produce, and stockpile for Barbarossa, the Germans had enough fundamental materials of war to win in the Soviet Union in 1941. The German logistical problem was how to transport material from adequate stockpiles to an army operating under difficult circumstances in a large country without normal-gauge railways and with unpaved roads. The Germans would center logistics on the construction of rail lines and station installations. They would also organize great truck forces to move materials from stockpiles on the frontier until the new rail lines could be completed and rail heads (i.e., train stations where supplies were stockpiled) could be established in the Soviet Union. The Germans organized great logistical truck forces behind each army group to pick up supplies from the frontier rail heads and deliver them into truck dumps as close as possible to the advancing field armies. The truck forces, broken down into flexible 60-ton-capacity columns of vehicles to move supplies, would operate back and forth from the frontier stockpiles until the new train stations and German-gauge rail lines could support traffic into the Soviet Union to forward rail heads."

Charles' 35,000 troops were crippled, and by spring only 19,000 were left. The Battle of Poltava in 1709 sealed the end of the Swedish Empire. Napoleon's Grande Armée of 610,000 men invaded Russia, heading towards Moscow, in 1812. The Russian army retreated before the French and again burnt their crops and villages, denying the enemy their use. Napoleon's army was ultimately reduced to 100,000. During the cold winter of 1941-1942, the Wehrmacht lacked necessary supplies, such as winter uniforms, due to the many delays in the German army's movements. Hitler was so confident of a quick victory that he did not prepare for even the possibility of winter warfare in Russia.

They counterproposed a division that would follow existing state boundaries, which ran along the eastern border of Iran, northern Afghanistan, the western border of China and then along the Yenisei River.\n \nHistorically, Hitler approved the Japanese proposal.

Arndt called for a United, strong and proud Kingdom, uniting all Germans. Again this topic arose during the revolution of 1848 at the Frankfurt Assembly, but its implementation was hampered by disagreements between the multinational Austrian movement and Prussia's desire to dominate in Germany. The essence of the problem was formulated as follows: to become a great Germany (Grossdeutsch) or to be a small German settlement (Kleindeutsch)? The latter would mean Prussian hegemony. The unification of Germany occurred under Otto von Bismarck in 1871 under the Kleindeutsch concept. For Hitler, an Austrian by birth, the Third Reich made no sense without the inclusion of Austria; moreover, great Germany could not exist without the accession of Czechoslovakia. Hitler embodied the idea of expansion from the first days of his regime: Germany returned to the Saarland, left the League of Nations, remilitarized Rhineland, annulled the Locarno agreement, carried out the Anschluss of Austria, captured Czechoslovakia. Great Germany included most of Western Europe in the first years of the WWII. By 1944, Germany issued postage stamps on which instead of "Deutsches Reich" was printed "Grossdeutsches Reich". Hitler practically carried out the aspirations of many German nationalists.\n \nThis Pan-german Empire will embody the vision of Hitler set out in "Mein Kampf", and will unite all the German peoples in a superpower, covering the entire continent and designed to create ideal conditions for the future civilization of the Aryan Race.

According to this plan, the most valuable industrial equipment was supposed to be sent to the Reich, and the one that can not be useful to Germany — to destroy. The territory of the European part of the USSR was planned to decentralize economically and make the agricultural raw material appendage of Germany. The initial version of the plan was approved at a secret meeting on March 1, 1941 (Protocol 1317 PS).\n \nOver the next two months, the plan was elaborated and finally approved on 29 April 1941 (minutes of the secret meeting 1157 P.S.). According to the plan, the territory of the USSR was divided into four economic inspectorates (Leningrad, Moscow, Kiev, Baku) and 23 economic commandant's offices, as well as 12 bureaus. For coordination the headquarters "Oldenburg" was formed. May 8, 1941 was the adoption of "General instructions for all Reich Commissars in the occupied Eastern territories" based on this plan (documents 1029, 1030 PS). A separate Commission was formed to organize the collection of food in the occupied territories. She was given the task to provide by 1942 the supply of the German armed forces with food completely at the expense of the resources of the USSR. All the rest of the food from the agricultural regions was supposed to be exported to Germany, thereby reducing the "excess population" of the industrial centers of the USSR. In accordance with the order of the chief of staff of the high command of the Wehrmacht Wilhelm Keitel of June 16, 1941, the main economic task in the occupied territories of the USSR was defined as "immediate and full exploitation of the occupied areas in the interests of the military economy of Germany, especially in the field of food and oil."\n \nReichsmarschall Goering, who directly headed the headquarters of "Oldenburg", wrote: "In the East, I intend to rob, and rob effectively. Everything that can be suitable for the Germans in the East, should be quickly extracted and delivered to Germany."\n \nAfter the beginning of the Barbarossa, July 15, 1941, he wrote in his "Green Folder": "The use of the areas to be occupied should be made primarily in the food and oil sectors of the economy. To get as much food and oil as possible for Germany is the main economic goal of the campaign."\n \nAfter the end of the war, the activities of the headquarters of Oldenburg became the subject of consideration and condemnation at the Nuremberg Tribunal."

Officially neutral throughout the conflict, it did not go unnoticed by the participating powers that certain groups in Ireland had overlapping interests with the ambitions of the Third Reich, most notably antagonism between the Irish Republican Army and the question of Northern Ireland. The Allied powers also showed considerable interest in Ireland, and the country's leadership had to maintain a careful balance of diplomatic relations in order to not compromise their neutrality.\n \nWith the occupation of the British Isles, the area of Northern Ireland came under our control. We can now decide on how to best leverage this situation to advantage. If we were to grant these provinces to Ireland, we could easily bring them into our sphere of influence. Given the geopolitical situation with the collapse of the British Empire, they would realistically have no choice but to accept. This would then allow us to influence the leadership of Ireland to align with our vision of the European New Order, along with ensuring our security in the northern Atlantic and creating a counterweight towards the British.

For the first time in history, paratroops were used to spearhead an assault. The Germans soon established themselves there and by the following day, 10th April, operated more than 50 transport aircraft from the airport. The Germans needed Aalborg to maintain the supply line to the units fighting in Norway. They immediately began a major expansion and as soon as 13th July 1940 the first of two new concrete runways was operational.  Later came 19 wooden hangars, barracks, point-defense bunkers and flak (anti-aircraft) batteries.\n \nIn the course of the war, Aalborg-West together with the neighbouring aviator Horst Grove was expanded into one of the most fortified airfields of the Air Force in occupied Western Europe. Between November 1942 and the beginning of January 1944 there was a season of the IV.group of night hunting squadrons 3 (IV./NJG 3), which was initially equipped with Bf 110 and Do 217, in Aalborg-West. The latter was replaced by Ju 88C in the summer of 1943.\n \nFlight operations throughout the war were to provide supply and troop transport flights to and from Norway. In addition, operations included maritime reconnaissance over the North Sea, fighter escort for air strikes against northern England and Scotland and support of night-fighter operations and training. The base was attacked by the Royal Air Force in April 1940 in an unsuccessful attempted to prevent the Germans sending reinforcements to Norway.\n \nOn the other side of the Limfjord, just south of Aalborg West, the Germans started in late summer 1940 the construction of a seaplane base. A 300 metre long pier was constructed for mooring sea-planes ready for action. A crane could lift the aircraft onto land, if they needed maintenance in the large hangar. The development of the airfield continued throughout the war with bunkers and pillboxes for point defense, all surrounded by barbed wire. In all, 11 crew bunkers and a large hospital bunker were built to support the garrison of around 1,500 men. By the time of liberation in May 1945 the base acted as a sea rescue service facility, as well as a training center for future seaplane pilots."

As a result, people were killed, 30 thousand were sent to concentration camps, hundreds of synagogues were burnt down, and windows of houses and shop of Jews were broken. All the streets were covered with shards of glass-hence the name "Crystal Night". Then the official propaganda called these events the expression of Patriotic feelings of the German people. "Crystal Night" was a turning point in the fate of the Jewish people and a direct consequence of the most terrible crime in the history of the world – the Holocaust, which resulted in the destruction of 6 million Jews.\n \nThe USSR Newspapers published reports of protests against "Crystal Night" around the world, including a meeting held on November 15 in the Great hall of the Moscow Conservatory and adopted a resolution condemning Anti-Semitic excesses on behalf of the "Soviet intelligentsia". The President of the United States in protest only recalled from Berlin the American Ambassador for consultations. The protest was also expressed by Britain and France, but diplomatic relations with Nazi Germany did not break, and their ambassadors remained in Berlin.

Predominantly German-speaking in its central territories with a substantial Francophone population in the west and Italian and Romansch spoken in the south, the Swiss Confederation felt its multilingual, decentralized democracy was under extreme threat by Hitler's vision of a Greater Germanic Reich and the National Socialist worldview.\n \nAfter the fall of France, the fate of Switzerland is very uncertain, as its geostrategically important location makes it a potential military target. The occupation of Switzerland, with its well-developed transport infrastructure, could significantly ease the problem of supplying our troops in Africa and southern France. With a coordinated strike from Germany and France, supported by Italian troops, we can easily defeat Switzerland and keep its transport infrastructure intact.\n \nOn the other hand, investments in the Swiss military industry can become a much more profitable option for us.

The Home Guard guarded the coastal areas of the United Kingdom and other important places such as airfields, factories and explosives stores. By late 1940, the Home Guard had amassed 847,000 rifles, 47,000 shotguns and 49,000 machine guns of various kinds.

The Patriotic circles of Iraq were not satisfied with this situation, and king Ghazi I tried to pursue a policy independent from us, but to no avail. Part of the anti-British Iraqi military, grouped in the 1930s around German Ambassador Fritz Grobba, became known as the "Circle of Seven", and their leaders — as the "Golden four". After the suppression of the anti-British uprising in Palestine, many of its participants found refuge in Iraq, here later moved and rebel leader, a former mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husseini.\n \nThe result of this growth of anti-British sentiment was a coup in Iraq. On 1 April 1941, the regime of Regent Abd al-Ilah was overthrown, and Rashid Ali al-gaylani was declared Prime Minister. The coup was led by four Iraqi generals, who were in the nationalist group 'Golden Square'. Since Iraq gained only formal independence in 1932, the aim of the group was to use the war to achieve full independence and the establishment of the pan-Arab state, which led to cooperation with German intelligence and the adoption of military assistance from Germany.\n \nThe situation in Iraq has reached a critical point. With this coup, we have lost control over the Iraqi oil fields and transport hub Kuwait - Palestine - Egipet. In addition, the new Iraqi government is a centric ally of Germany, which could pose a threat to Kuwait and Palestine. The military leadership insists on an early invasion and occupation of Iraq."

BP_england.4.d:0 "Since the 30s, the Third Reich has been looking for possible allies in the Middle East. One such potential partner was Iran. Despite the strong position of British capital, which played a key role in the Iranian economy, the geopolitical bias towards the Third Reich became stronger. In addition, since 1933 Berlin has taken relations with Iran to a new qualitative level. Reich begins to take an active part in the development of the economy, infrastructure of Iran, the reform of the armed forces of the monarchy. In the Third Reich, Iranian youth, the military, whom Goebbels propaganda called "Sons of Zaratushtra", are being trained. German ideologists declared the Persians "Pure Aryans" and they were exempted from the Nuremberg Racial Laws by a special decree. As a result, by the beginning of the Second World War, the Third Reich had gained a strong position in Iran, and in fact the country was turning into a German base in the Middle East region. By 1941, the situation with Iran and its "aryan bias" for Moscow and London was as follows: there was a real threat that Iran's oil and transport infrastructure built on British capital will be used by the Third Reich against the USSR and Britain. Thus, only one oil refinery in Abadan processed 8 million tons of oil in 1940. And aviation gasoline in the whole region was produced only in Baku and Abadan. In addition, if the German armed forces broke from North Africa to Palestine, Syria, or in 1942 reached the border of Baku – Derbent – Astrakhan, Turkey and Iran's entry into the war on the side of Germany would be a matter resolved. In connection with the planned offensive of the Wehrmacht deep into the Soviet Union, the Persian corridor, passing through the territory of the trans-Iranian railway, was one of the easiest ways to implement the lend-lease program implemented by the United States by sea. British and Soviet engineers recognized the great importance of this railway and sought to keep it under close attention. The increased number of attacks by German submarines and the ice covering of the sea in the area of Arkhangelsk have increased the danger of using this route, so that the need for the use of the railway has increased significantly. Moreover, the Soviet government sought to include Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmensahra ("Turkmen plain") part of the state, and to bring to power in Iran, the Communists. The pressure of the UK and the USSR on Iran led to an increase in tension and a massive anti-British speech in Tehran, which, according to the British, were of a Pro-German nature. Iran's strategic position hampered the security of the Soviet oil-producing areas and the rear of the red Army and threatened British military routes between India and the Mediterranean."

In 1934, they were merged into Italian Libya, which included concessions from British Sudan and territorial changes with Egypt.\n \nWith the appointment of Italian Governor Italo Balbo, Italian Libya flourished - Italians in Libya numbered 108 419 (12.37 percent of the total population) at the time of the 1939 census, and Italians in less than thirty years (1911-1940) built huge public works (roads, buildings, ports, Railways and opened vast tracts of agricultural land).\n \nIn March 1937, Mussolini made a state visit to Libya, where he opened a new military highway running throughout the colony (Via Balbia). On the border of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania was built a large architectural structure called Fileni Arch, marking the completion of the road.\n \nDuring the Second world war, the road was of strategic importance, in fact, being the main communication line of supply to the warring parties.\n \nWhen Balbo died in a plane crash in 1940, the Italian government named the 1822-kilometer road after him."

It was an assertion of modern identity couched in crafted traditions and myths, one that evoked a powerful public endorsement evident in various enthusiastic expressions ranging from volunteer work brigades to dutiful pilgrimages to sacred sites. The celebrations were also aimed at shoring up national morale as the death toll from war against China had reached 100,000. Invoking the virtues of the Yamato race and continuous imperial rule promoted stoic perseverance in the face of adversity, rendering sacrifice a patriotic duty.

BP_germany.802.d:0 "Mittelafrika is the name created for a geostrategic region in central and east Africa. Much like Mitteleuropa, it articulated Germany's foreign policy aim, prior to World War I, of bringing the region under German domination. The difference being that Mittelafrika would presumably be an agglomeration of German colonies in Africa, while Mitteleuropa was conceptualised as a geostrategic buffer zone between Germany and Russia to be filled with puppet states.\n \nGerman strategic thinking was that if the region between the colonies of German East Africa (Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanganyika (Tanzania minus the island of Zanzibar)), German South-West Africa (Namibia minus Walvis Bay), and Cameroon could be annexed, a contiguous entity could be created covering the breadth of the African continent from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Given the richness in natural resources of the Congo Basin alone, this region would accrue considerable wealth to the colonising power through the exploitation of natural resources, as well as contributing to another German aim of economic self-sufficiency.\n \nShould we Establish this Colonial Administration?"

The government and king Ghazi of Iraq ruled only on a technicality. In fact, everything was decided by the representatives of London. This state of Affairs was consolidated by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930."

SWI_national_redoubt_desc:0 "The National Redoubt, also the Swiss Redoubt, is a defensive plan developed by the government of Switzerland in the late 19th century to repel foreign attacks. At the beginning of WWII, the plan was expanded and refined to counter the potential invasion of Nazi Germany, which was planned, but never took place.The term "Redoubt" originally refers to a system of fortifications built since the 1880s to protect Central Switzerland as a fortified area for the retreat of the Swiss army. It was a complex of fortifications in the Alps along the lines of "East-West" with the three main fortresses: Saint-Maurice, Saint Gotthard and Sargans. These fortresses primarily defended the Alpine passages between Germany and Italy and did not cover the industrial densely populated interior of Switzerland. Inland areas, in turn, were under the protection of fortifications, "Borderline" and "Army line" — a significant, but non insurmountable. On the contrary, the redoubt complex of structures is designed as completely impregnable, which would not give the aggressor the opportunity to cross the Alps from North to South through mountain passes or railway tunnels. This strategy was to contain any invasion, making it meaningless because of the impossibility of using the Swiss transport infrastructure."
