The country was ruled as a one-party republic under Wang Jingwei, a very high-ranking former Kuomintang (KMT) official. The region that it would administer was initially seized by Japan throughout the late 1930s with the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Wang, a rival of Chiang Kai-shek and member of the pro-peace faction of the KMT, defected to the Japanese side and formed a collaborationist government in occupied Nanking (Nanjing) (the traditional capital of China) in 1940.

Furthermore, the Golden Horn with city and port in Vladivostok could serve us as the naval base for our navy.\n\nThis is a great success for us and all of China and people will surely support our government even more.

However, the real power was in the hands of Chiang Kai-shek, who was in near complete control of the military as the superintendent of the Whampoa Military Academy.\n\nNow, long after its establishment, Kuomintang is interwoven with corruption and mismatch.

He attended university there, but when the Chinese Nationalists violently broke with the Communists, he was sent to work in a steel factory in the Ural Mountains. Chiang Kai-shek refused to negotiate a prisoner swap for his son in exchange for a Chinese Communist Party leader, stating that 'It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son.'.\n\nHowever now, with our recent rapprochement with Nationalist China, it seems that it would be more profitable to side with the Nationalists over the Communists once again.

He banned smoking, gambling and prostitution, studied governmental management, allowed for economic expansion and a change in social outlook. Through this he achieved social and economic stability and raised the People's Support for Kuomintang. As soon as these primary goals were achieved he focused on strengthening education and culture, utilizing his knowledge gained in the Soviet Union. That is to be achieved by increasing number of national and junior high schools and by emphasizing policies to eliminate illiterate people. Newspapers and other medias were also to be expanded.\n\nThe key stones of his First Three Year South-South Plan is to to remove feudalism that nests in society, enhance nationalism and improve production skills in carrying out national education based on Sun Yat-sen Three Principles.\n\nHis efforts are being hailed as a miracle in the political war in China and coined as the 'Gannan New Deal', but also critisied by some members of Kuomintang for use of almost-communists methods, saying that 'Chiang Ching-kuo is a real communist and South China is already red'."
