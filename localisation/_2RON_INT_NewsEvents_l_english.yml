ronint_news.1.d:0 "The Sultan Mehmed V tragically passed away on the 3rd of July 1918 at the age of 73 (only four months before the end of WWI, thus he did not see the downfall of the Empire). During his Reign since the forced abdication of his Brother Abdulhamid II by the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, Mehmed V had no 'real power' he was mainly a figure head. His main political act was declaring a Jihad, or a Struggle against the Entente Powers on November 14th 1914 following the Ottoman Empire's decision to join the war on the side of the Central Powers."

ronint_news.2.d:0 "From January 10th to 20th, Aviators from all around the United States and the world met in Dominguez Field outside of Los Angeles for the first ever International Air Meeting. During this meet the world would see some interesting designs, some becomming ubiquitous in the aeronautical scene in the coming years and decades, such as the Triplane and early Monoplane prototypes. While, other ideas here would die very soon thereafter and not garnish much support such as the double biplane and the gyroplane, which will never see much use outside of experimentation. The contestants were competing for $75,000 in potential prise money, and the events taking place from 2 PM onwards averaged 20,000 specatators per day. New air speed records and altitude records were set at 55 MPH(89 KPH) and 4,164 feet(1,269m), respectively."

ronint_news.3.d:0 "In 1907, it was postulated that soon famous operas and other performances could be sent out using radio wirelessly into people's homes around major cities. In 1910, on the night of January 13 this became a reality, when Lee de Forest's Radio Telephone Company finaced a large event; Wherein several microphones were set up at the stage of multiple opera performances and the sound was transmitted to several publicly available recievers for people to listen in. While the exercise has been deemed a filure, it was  not of the radio transmission but the poor quality of the microphones that led to the transmission being very poor quality."
