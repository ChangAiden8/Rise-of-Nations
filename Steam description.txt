1) WHY CAN'T I SEE ALL THE START DATES?
The Start Dates are currently being worked on, they will be added one at a time in chronological order.

2) OMG, YOU STOLE STUFF FROM OTHER MODS!!
Permission has been granted from the developers of other mods, and they have been duly credited in the description. We are not competing with any other mods, as we are a timeline expansion mod.

3) HOW DO I CHANGE TO THE NEXT ERA FOCUS TREES?
Focus Trees will be reloaded automatically by event.

4) I CAN'T CHANGE SUCH AND SUCH LAW!
If you can't change a law you either do not meet the requirements, the law changes automatically by event, or it hasn't been implemented yet.

5) MANDARIN CHINESE TRANSLATION WHEN?
Due to the massive amount of work to be done to bring this project to completion, any translation that gets done, will be done by the community. We have enough on our hands.

6) OMG RISE OF NATIONS IS THE NAME OF A GAME!

7) CUSTOM FOCUS TREE FOR X COUNTRY WHEN?
When the structure of the mod is complete, and all the basics are in place. Then we will add custom focus trees to all your favourite countries.

8) DMCA?
We don't know, who has put yet another DMCA upon our mod within the first few hours after releasing it. We think that it were the same guys that did it before and are now just trolling.
